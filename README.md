# Installation
***MAKE SURE mosh IS INSTALLED ON YOUR CLIENT AND YOUR SERVER***

For Ubuntu, **run apt install mosh**.

Follow a similar instruction for your Linux distro.
For the Mac, use Home Brew and run 

**brew install mosh**
For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Fast-SSH README](https://github.com/Julien-R44/fast-ssh#installation). 

**Note:** The primary change in Fast-Mosh is that it uses `mosh` instead of `ssh`. You can use the same installation method with `fast-mosh`.

# Usage
The usage remains the same to Fast-SSH, but instead of executing `ssh`, you will execute `mosh` to connect to your services. 

Mosh ensures session restarts from your ssh connection. No more broken pipes or connections. You can hibernate your computer and your session reconnects once your resume (AS LONG AS THE TERMINAL WAS NOT CLOSED OR SERVER REBOOTED) Just make sure you have mosh installed locally and on the remote server.

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Fast-SSH README](https://github.com/Julien-R44/fast-ssh#documentation).
